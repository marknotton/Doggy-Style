# Doggy Style [![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/marknotton/doggystyle.svg)](https://github.com/marknotton/doggystyle/releases)

A collection of Sass resources found from an array of sources, forums, and tutorials. Many of my own mixins and functions have been writen to take advantage of Sass lists and maps, allowing users to enter settings without strict ordering.

  Alternatively, you can install Doggy Style with [Bower](http://bower.io).

1. Install the Doggy Style library into the current directory:

  **Pro Tip:** You can target installation into a specific directory using the `path` flag:
